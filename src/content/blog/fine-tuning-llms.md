# Fine-tuning LLMs on Custom Datasets

When working with large language models, pre-trained weights get you 80% of the way there. But for domain-specific tasks — like classifying cybersecurity alerts or parsing job application emails — fine-tuning on your own data is where the real gains happen.

## Why Fine-tune?

Prompt engineering has its limits. When you need...
